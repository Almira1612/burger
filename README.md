# burger
## Overview
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Before You Begin
- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
- Each burger in the waiting area can click to devour. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
- Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Instructions

this app is now deployed to Heroku: https://hidden-plains-21447.herokuapp.com/

To run the application locally, first clone this repository with the following command.

- git clone https://github.com/Almira1612/burger.git
- cd burger
- npm install
- run the node server locally.
node server.js

Now, open the local application on port 3000 at the URL: http://localhost:3000/.
